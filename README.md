Creating my first compiler from scratch




What we know so far:

    * We need a parser/tokenizer
        There are 7 catagories in a lexical analyzer.
           - Identifier
           - Keyword
           - Seperator
           - operator
           - literal
           - comment
           - whitespace
        
        The best way to understand parser is to look at context free grammar because it provides
        a better visual to how this works. Context free grammar is exactly what a compiler is
        going through when compiling.
